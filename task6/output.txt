totally agree with samcl main reason for not using assembler anymore is that you cannot access the Videomemory Back in the early days mentioned Castle there was a special video mode called where your graphic was just a block of pixel was a palette coloer ranging from You were able to access this memory through this specific video today things are much more you have very fast Videomemory and using your CPU for accessing it will just tear down all as you CPU is connected through remembering is often a lot of read and write check if it is multiply with write modern memory Interfaces are much slower than direct access the graphic why you really should use as Robert Gould In this way you can write faster and easier to understand code and it will not stall your your beginner assembler code will be pretty in quality as in Trust It needs a lot of time for optimizing such primitive So your compiled Code will outperform your handwritten asm you are initerested in try to code something like This is where you can gain a lot of

the case of embedded systems and code written in I try and avoid memory as much as The main reason I do this is not necessarily performance but this rule of thumb does have performance used to manage the heap are notoriously slow in some platforms Even the time that it takes to return from a call to malloc is highly dependent on the current state of the any function that calls malloc is going to take a performance hit that cannot be easily accounted That performance hit may be minimal if the heap is still clean but after that device runs for a while the heap can become The calls are going to take longer and you cannot easily calculate how performance will degrade over You cannot really produce a worse case The optimizer cannot provide you with any help in this case To make matters even if the heap becomes too heavily the calls will start failing The solution is to use memory pools instead of the The allocation calls are going to be much faster and deterministic if you do it
