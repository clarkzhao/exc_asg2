need to make an ajax call from a site to a service exposed on another site and server and I need to make it so that sure that the call is a genuine call from the client site and are the best methods to obtain ajax
you want to follow the Microsoft style guide with your code sources Have you tried using the for ReSharper recommended disable the internal ReSharper naming rule set or toggle the inspection StyleCop the StyleCop ReSharper allows inheritance over the files in your solution folder So you are able to check for valid names in the while the analysis of the test code is
the as or or that will probably give you all those nodes rather than only one in the priority I tried this out and it but it should do what you need appropriate changes for your and and and ran it on the following test commenting out each line to test the different parts and it works as notice that I quite solved the problem yet as you want the best match rather than a match in order of This can be done but would require a rather long XPath that does the equivalent of each combination in I know of any other way to simplify

work in recently ran a software development procurement process and selected three vendors to work on an Agile Some were already sure we wanted to run an Agile project because we knew our requirements were ambiguous and because it was a web project with a significant design So say that it helps a lot if your client knows about Agile and buys in from the even if they actually practice it Note that acceptance of Agile is growing in government so this may get safeguard we used was to contract a very experienced SCRUM master to work for us and handle the software project management duties on behalf of our team lead architect usability We spent a lot of time finding this and selected them from three great This was costly but worth we had selected our vendors and broadly agreed their roles we put together a quick MoU outlining our intention to the likely budget of the the likely size of the team from each a commitment to have a full contract signed by the end of the and a time materials agreement in the we jumped in with a technical planning sizing session and got that side of things No dev work or design was done in this but we did a lot of sizing and the end of the month we put together contracts for each vendor was but that was One vendor put forward sample contracts that we might one based on payment by thirds of the the other on completion of I think in the end we did completion of sprints using some of the language in the payments section of our standard contract we were okay with this approach acknowledging some because we think there was a huge amount of actual technical risk in the project and because we had a lot of confidence in the procurement process and in the vendors we had the end this was a very successful and we have since started using SCRUM for other I think having a great team was We were confident in the vendors not only that they could do the but that they were a good fit in terms of their attitude to working as one and in terms of there being roles for each they would not be competing for the same our vendors had not been so we would have had a few more reservations about entering into a contract like but running procurement is almost as much an art as a and we knew we had chosen the team with the best fit an attitude from a pool of other have since rolled over all three contracts for a second year of though say it s not going quite as smoothly this time SCRUM different team it is still a great project to be involved may also find this
have a bunch of sub projects in various I want to specify them as a then for a given target I want to go through each and call got something I would have to specify a separate subant line for each project and each target All I want to do is create a property that is a list of and use that It should be yet do I apply targets to a sublist of projects in

is happening is compiler is creating an internal class that it emits at compile This class is called the GUID component of this class is generated at compile time so it changes with every Internally in this class there is a dictionary that contains the different case and an int corresponding to each It then replaces the switch statement with a lookup in the dictionary to get the corresponding and does a switch on the int value more efficient than doing a bunch of sting

HTTPS is not Specially when we are talking about protecting user data from troyans with access at winsock32 level where they can sniff https in plain text or BHOs objects that already have access to the decrypted posted data in the browser this I have developed a javascript classic asp client server in wich the javascript encrypts and send the data received and decrypted by It works very solution was built with xICE encryption wich offers a good compatibility between javascript and PHP or But now migrating to or to Java and no port for these environments in Encryption Libraries between client a server side or

the end of the security you could have the server for the client application create a signed message using a private and include that message in the html of the Then the ajax call would forward that message in its call at which time the ajax server could the message would change to include user timestamp so that a known good message could not be saved off and reused by a malicious

used going to have to help git find the correct commit to perform the rebase going to guess but presumably you have an common commit which has two the head of your public branch and the place on your dev branch that this commit corresponds to Call the public head commit and the dev commit that this corresponds to the dev branch checked you want to do something like rebase tells rebase to take the patches introduced by each commit since on the current branch and to apply these commits to I think that this is what you update to the question shows that h is equivalent to the head of the public stream on the dev branch and that you want to transplant everything from here onwards on the dev branch onto the public If so the command rebase pub
wrote this before your clarifying comment so it probably quite is not sure if a lookup table approach is possible or If you really need arbitrary then take advantage of the a solution is I believe that the following is what you are looking for is something like the It probably contains bugs in edge but it does compile and work as expected at least for positive Making it really work is an exercise for the convert a numerical string of base a printable binary int int Generates a printable binary representation of an input from an arbitrary The input number is passed as the character string The input string consists of from the ASCII character set letter characters may be in either upper or lower The number of characters from the input string which consumed by this The output string is placed newly allocated storage which is pointed to by upon An error is signalled by returning const int char int rc char char unsigned long num if then we have some numbers int numdig rc we have this many base we need this many base 2 digits if return return the buffer outp make sure it is NUL terminated while fill it in from LSb to MSb num return

difficult to fully answer your question without specifying a programming answer with respect to because for all I know the answer might be is a then a server first binds to a port by calling This creates a socket in server It is prepared to catch data on port one calls This throws the socket into server This means that a request for a connection will be received by this socket to 10 pending requests at a the time we get to the operating system already knows listening on port merely says what going to do with the requests we In will return where connection is a connection through another In this is not very different from the socket object that the client has reasonably symmetric from here on

no reason to request search terms with every Google does it because they and because presenting terms across the corpus of the most web there are a much smaller number of search terms usually no more than a hundred or and as few as a dozen that are context can retrieve the entire set of relevant terms and build a prefix map on the client side at the time the page By matching the current search term against this prefix you can give suggestions far faster that limitation is at some run out of suggested But really not an even Google runs out of suggestions for but there are 191 results from a full

a scheduled interval I need to call a WCF service call another WCF Service Scheduling a call to a WCF service I have worked I think I need and I have read about here on stackoverflow that it is necessary prepare or change the code of your WCF services as to be able to handle an async call to If so what would a simple example of that look a before and after Also is it still necessary in I am using a proxy from the WCF Service doing the call to the next WCF Service and need a sample of an async call to a WCF service if it looks any different than what is typical with BeginEnvoke and EndEnvoke with typical async would believe it if I am completely off on my question and would appreciate any correction to establish a better question as sample fire and forget async call to WCF
